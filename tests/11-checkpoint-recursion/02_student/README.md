#### Total Points: 6.00

#### Description:

There are many different kinds of students! You should create a general Student class that will have specific properties and functions on its prototype. Then you should extend the general Student Class to create another type of Student, an Alumni.

**Note:** The ES2015 class syntax needs to be used (do not create a constructor function)
