2. Before solving a problem, read the `README.md` file located in the problem's directory (folder). The `README.md` file provides a general overview of the problem and will give you additional context when reading the Test Specs.

3. Write your solution code in the `solution_${problem-name}.js` file.

4. Run the test specs to test your code. Prior to starting the checkpoint, it was instructed that you are are responsible for your development environment. Follow the instructions below to run the test specs:

#### NPM Install and NPM Test

1. Run the command:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Note: the command **needs to be executed inside of the foundations-checkpoint-final-r directory**.

2. After the installation is complete, when you want to run `testem` run the command:
